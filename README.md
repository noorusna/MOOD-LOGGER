The Mood Tracker Web App helps you keep track of your moods every day. You can pick how you’re feeling, write a quick note about your day, and look back at your past entries to see patterns over time.
 AI helped me come up with the app’s features, figure out how to organize moods, suggest ways to make charts, and even write user friendly prompts.
